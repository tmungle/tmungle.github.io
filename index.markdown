    <p>Hi, I am postdoctoral scholar at <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/boussard-lab.html">Boussard Lab</a>, <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/">BMIR</a>, Stanford University.</p>
    <p>I work in the field of clinical/medical informatics utilizing real-world data (Electronic Health Records) to generate evidence-base solutions for clinical problems and develop implementable solutions/systems. The research aims to assist various stakeholders in the hospital settings that can significantly impact and improve patient outcomes, health care delivery and policies. Alongside these, my efforts align with fostering technological tools that empower clinicians and patients for better healthcare delivery.

In the realm of functional genomics, I have gained experience working with single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene insertion/deletion. I have employed this information to correlate clinical data, leading to a more profound understanding and optimal treatment delivery strategies. Moreover, my skill set extends into medical image analysis, further broadening my abilities in data interpretation and clinical application.
