<ul>
  <li>Advancing Ocular Phenotype Identification using Large Language Models (LLMs): Streamlining Clinical Assessments to Reduce Human Burden
    <ul>
      <li>A multi-site study, aims to understand use of LLMs to improve utilization of longitudinal unstructured clinical data to identify (and annotate) phenotypes as compared to traditional methods thereby by reducing human efforts</li>
      <li>Understand LLM-based systems with different prompting strategies and retrieval augmented generation techniques to reduce time and cost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enhancing Accurate Identification of Occular Phenotypes from Real-World Datasets <a href="/media/GLA_Ensemble.pdf" target="_blank">(<strong>Graphical Abstract</strong>)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of various resampling techniques and ensemble learning to build ML models using structured and unstructured data to improve accurate detection of patients with and without glaucoma. The proposed method performed better than traditional structured data ML models.</li>
      <li>Models were evaluated for fairness and biases across various demographic sub-groups. Additionally, uncertainity evaluation for model predictions was proposed. Further, ML models were evaluated for explainability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Maintenance Therapy (MT) Practice at LPCH Hospital, Stanford using allMT R library and VIATAMIN application (<strong><em>Co-Investigator</em></strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>The objective is to utilize the allMT and VIATAMIN application to analyze MT data for LPCH hospital ALL patients, and test the adaptability and generalizability of the tools in diverse healthcare settings, contributing to broader use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outcomes among Hospitalized Homeless Individuals
    <ul>
      <li>The study analysed impact of homelessness on endoscopy utilization, surgical treatment and post-operative complications among hospitalized patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease using propensity score matching method.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

          <li>Developed <a href="https://ananyam.shinyapps.io/VIATAMIN/">VIATAMIN application</a> as an assitive and audit tool for physicians to deliver optimal MT</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Modelling clinical decision processes
        <ul>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pilot study to understand the effect of allopurinol adjuvant during MT
        <ul>
          <li><ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Study showed clinical benefit in mitigating non-haematological 6MP toxicity. However, close monitoring with this intervention along with pharmacological monitoring is required in future.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Evolution of virtual care management of MT in ALL at TMC
        <ul>
          <li><ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The transition from in-person visits to e-mailing the blood count reports during MT reduced the financial burden and improved quality of life for patients and families <br /></li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evaluated treatment cost and cost-effectiveness of a risk-stratified therapy to treat pediatric ALL
    <ul>
      <li><ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The cost-effective risk-stratified approach reduced the ALL treatment cost for standard and intermediate risk patients through decreased inpatient admissions, as compared to high risk patients <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyzing clinical characteristics and outcome data of patients with (A) IKZF1 gene-deleted ALL;
(B) Gallbladder cancer
    <ul>
