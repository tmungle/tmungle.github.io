**Current Projects** (July 2023 onwards - ongoing) <br>

**<ins>Clincial Informatics</ins>**

- **Advancing Ocular Phenotype Identification Using Real-World Datasets** <br>
<ins>Collaborators</ins>: University of Michigan
	- Using Large Language Models (LLMs): Streamlining Clinical Assessments to Reduce Human Burden 
		- A multi-site study, aims to understand use of LLMs to improve utilization of longitudinal unstructured clinical data to [**identify**](/media/LLM_for_Phenotype_Identification.pdf){:target="_blank"} OR [**annotate**](/media/LLM_as_Medical_Annotators.pdf){:target="_blank"} phenotypes as compared to traditional methods thereby by reducing human efforts
		- Understand LLM-based systems with different prompting strategies and retrieval augmented generation techniques to reduce time and cost.
	- [Explainability and Fairness in Machine Learning Methods](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/8/4/ooaf080/8229755){:target="_blank"}
		- Use of various resampling techniques and ensemble learning to build ML models using structured and unstructured data to improve accurate detection of patients with and without glaucoma. The proposed method performed better than traditional structured data ML models. 
		- Models were evaluated for fairness and biases across various demographic sub-groups. Additionally, uncertainity evaluation for model predictions was proposed. Further, ML models were evaluated for explainability.

**Projects completed** (2018 - March 2023) <br>

**<ins>Clincial Informatics</ins>**

- **Design, Development and Implementation of Data-Driven Strategies in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) maintenance therapy (MT) at Tata Medical Center, India** [(**Graphical Abstract**)](/media/ALL_MT.pdf){:target="_blank"} <br>
<ins>Collaborators</ins>: Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India; PGIMER, Chandigarh, India, Tata Consultancy Services, India
	- Develop a [data repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/775hs9wrb5/1){:target="_blank"} for MT from paper and electronic based records 
	- Analyzing MT practice for patients who completed ALL tretment
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Dosing protocol was revisited by hospitalâ€™s pediatric ALL team and attempts were made to adhere to the MT protocol
		- Developed [allMT R library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/allMT/index.html){:target="_blank"} to analyze MT data
		- Developed [VIATAMIN application](https://ananyam.shinyapps.io/VIATAMIN/){:target="_blank"} as an assitive and audit tool for physicians to deliver optimal MT
	- Modelling clinical decision processes 
		- Developed a dose advice software prototype to assist physician in personalizing dose prescription during MT
		- Developed a pill reminder mobile application for patients 	 
	- Pilot study to understand the effect of allopurinol adjuvant during MT
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Study showed clinical benefit in mitigating non-haematological 6MP toxicity. However, close monitoring with this intervention along with pharmacological monitoring is required in future. 
	- Evolution of virtual care management of MT in ALL at TMC
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The transition from in-person visits to e-mailing the blood count reports during MT reduced the financial burden and improved quality of life for patients and families <br>

- Evaluated treatment cost and cost-effectiveness of a risk-stratified therapy to treat pediatric ALL
	- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The cost-effective risk-stratified approach reduced the ALL treatment cost for standard and intermediate risk patients through decreased inpatient admissions, as compared to high risk patients <br>

- Analyzing clinical characteristics and outcome data of patients with (A) IKZF1 gene-deleted ALL;
(B) Gallbladder cancer
	- <ins>Brief</ins>: EMR data for demography, treatment and treatment response, pathology and outcome was extracted and analyzed to understand the target population

- Smart Heart Project
	- <ins>Brief</ins>: Developed R scripts to automate the process of linking longitudinal data from implantable device data with NHS Digital (hospital admissions data). Prediction of recovery heart failure risk score using frailty survival models.

	
**<ins>Functional Genomics</ins>**

- Developed a phenotypic data driven strategy to identify 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) sensitive children before the start of MT thereby reducing toxicity episodes during MT
	- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Reduce treatment cost and avoid pre-emptive genetic screening at the start of ALL treatment in a resource limited setting 
	- Correlation of *TPMT*, *NUDT15* and *ITPA* single nucleotide polymorphism with anti-metabolites and pre-maintenance therapy blood parameters.

- *IKZF1* gene insertion and deletion analysis using BlueFuse software. 
	- Illumina Beeline software was used to convert IDAT files to GTC. GRCh38 reference annotation database for CytoSNP-850K module was for analysis.

**Before 2018**

**<ins>Medical Image Analysis</ins>** <br>
- Developing automated image analysis methods for early prognosis of breast cancer using machine learning techniques for microscopic pathological images <br>
	- Methods: k-means; fuzzy c-means; spectral clustering, markov random fields; ensemble learning; neural networks
