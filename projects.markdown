**Projects completed** (2018 - March 2023) <br>

**<ins>Clinical Informatics</ins>**

- Methods/tools and proof-of-concepts to assits physicians in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) maintenance therapy (MT) 
	- Develop a [data repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/775hs9wrb5/1) for MT from paper and electronic based records 
	- Analyzing MT practice for patients who completed ALL treatment
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Dosing protocol was revisited by hospital’s pediatric ALL team and attempts were made to adhere to the MT protocol
		- Developed [allMT R library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/allMT/index.html) to analyze MT data
		- Developed [VIATAMIN application](https://ananyam.shinyapps.io/VIATAMIN/) as an assistive and audit tool for physicians to deliver optimal MT
	- Modelling clinical decision processes 
		- Developed a [dose advice software prototype](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pediatric-hematology-oncology-journal/vol/5/issue/4/suppl/S) to assist physician in personalizing dose prescription during MT
		- Developed a pill reminder mobile application for patients 	 
	- Pilot study to understand the [effect of allopurinol adjuvant during MT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pediatric-hematology-oncology-journal/vol/7/issue/4/suppl/S?page=2)
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Study showed clinical benefit in mitigating non-haematological 6MP toxicity. However, close monitoring with this intervention along with pharmacological monitoring is required in future. 
	- [Evolution of virtual care management of MT in ALL at TMC](https://journals.lww.com/jpho-online/fulltext/9900/hybrid_email_and_outpatient_clinics_to_optimize.343.aspx)
		- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The transition from in-person visits to e-mailing the blood count reports during MT reduced the financial burden and improved quality of life for patients and families <br>

- Evaluated [treatment cost and cost-effectiveness of a risk-stratified therapy to treat pediatric ALL](https://journals.lww.com/jpho-online/fulltext/2024/01000/hybrid_email_and_outpatient_clinics_to_optimize.7.aspx)
	- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: The cost-effective risk-stratified approach reduced the ALL treatment cost for standard and intermediate risk patients through decreased inpatient admissions, as compared to high risk patients <br>

- Analyzing clinical characteristics and outcome data of patients with (A) IKZF1 gene-deleted ALL;
(B) [Gallbladder cancer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cam4.5677)
	- <ins>Brief</ins>: EMR data for demography, treatment and treatment response, pathology and outcome was extracted and analyzed to understand the target population

- Smart Heart Project
	- <ins>Brief</ins>: Developed R scripts to automate the process of linking longitudinal data from implantable device data with NHS Digital (hospital admissions data). Prediction of recovery heart failure risk score using frailty survival models.

	
**<ins>Functional Genomics</ins>**

- Developed a phenotypic data driven strategy to identify 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) sensitive children before the start of MT thereby reducing toxicity episodes during MT
	- <ins>Translation and Clinical Relevance</ins>: Reduce treatment cost and avoid pre-emptive genetic screening at the start of ALL treatment in a resource limited setting 
	- Correlation of *TPMT*, *NUDT15* and *ITPA* single nucleotide polymorphism with anti-metabolites and pre-maintenance therapy blood parameters.

- *IKZF1* gene insertion and deletion analysis using BlueFuse software. 
	- Illumina Beeline software was used to convert IDAT files to GTC. GRCh38 reference annotation database for CytoSNP-850K module was used for analysis. Visual analysis and interpretation of the log r ratio and B allele freq to conclude homozygous or heterozygous gain/deletion was performed.

**Before 2018**

**<ins>Medical Image Analysis</ins>** <br>
- Developing automated image analysis methods for early prognosis of breast cancer using machine learning techniques for microscopic pathological images <br>
	- Methods: k-means; fuzzy c-means; spectral clustering, markov random fields; ensemble learning; neural networks
